Plugin to import, cache and display a JSON-Feed / JSON-API: Connect your Wordpress to an API / Webservice and display live JSON-data.


== Description ==

= Why Do I Need this Plugin on my Website? =
Display live data from a JSON-feed / API on your wordpress-site.

= JSON Content Importer - API- and Webservice-Connector - Powerful and Simple JSON-Import Plugin: =
* Use a template engine to display the data of an JSON-Feed.
* Define the url of the JSON-Feed, a template for it and other options like number of displayed items, cachetime etc..
* The template engine inserts the JSON-data in the template provided in the wordpress-shortcode inside a page - whereby some extras like urlencoding can be invoked.

= How to start and help =
* [Step 1 to 9 using this plugin, plus: examples and the PRO-Version](http://json-content-importer.com/support/faq/ "Step 1 to 9 using this plugin, plus: examples and the PRO-Version").


= Simple Example of wordpress-shortcode =
'[jsoncontentimporter

* url="http://...json"
* numberofdisplayeditems="number: how many items of level 1 should be displayed? display all: leave empty or set -1"
* urlgettimeout="number: who many seconds for loading url till timeout?"
* basenode="starting point of datasets, the base-node in the JSON-Feed where the data is"
* oneofthesewordsmustbein="default empty, if not empty keywords spearated by ','. At least one of these keywords must be in the created text (here: text=code without html-tags)"
* oneofthesewordsmustbeindepth="default: 1, number: where in the JSON-tree oneofthesewordsmustbein must be?"

]

Any HTML-Code plus "basenode"-datafields wrapped in "{}"
{subloop:"basenode_subloop":"number of subloop-datasets to be displayed"}
Any HTML-Code plus "basenode_subloop"-datafields wrapped in "{}". If JSON-data is HTML add "html" flag like "{fieldname:html}"
{/subloop:"basenode_subloop"}

[/jsoncontentimporter]'

* templates like "{subloop-array:AAAA:10}{text}{subloop:AAAA.image:10}{id}{/subloop:AAAA.image}{/subloop-array:AAAA}" are possible:
one is the recursive usage of "subloop-array" and "subloop".
the other is "{subloop:AAAA.image:10}" where "AAAA.image" is the path to an object. This is fine for some JSON-data.

= Some special add-ons for datafields =
* "{street:purejsondata}": Default-display of a datafield is NOT HTML, but HTML-Tags are converted : use this to use really the pure data from the JSON-Feed
* "{street:html}": Default-display of a datafield is NOT HTML: "&lt;" etc. are converted to "&amp,lt;". Add "html" to display the HTML-Code as Code.
* "{street:htmlAndLinefeed2htmlLinefeed}": Same as "{street:html}" plus "\n"-Linefeeds are converted to HTML-Linebreak
* "{street:ifNotEmptyAddRight:,}": If datafield "street" is not empty, add "," right of datafield-value. allowed chars are: "a-zA-Z0-9,;_-:&lt;&gt;/ "
* "{street:html,ifNotEmptyAddRight:extratext}": you can combine "html" and "ifNotEmptyAdd..." like this
* "{street:ifNotEmptyAdd:,}": same as "ifNotEmptyAddRight"
* "{street:ifNotEmptyAddLeft:,}": If datafield "street" is not empty, add "," left of datafield-value. allowed chars are: "a-zA-Z0-9,;_-:&lt;&gt;/ "
* "{locationname:urlencode}": Insert the php-urlencoded value of the datafield "locationname". Needed when building URLs
* "{locationname:unique}": only display the first instance of a datafield. Needed when JSON delivers data more than once


= JSON Content Importer PRO =
This free version of "JSON Content Importer" can put together many JSON-Feeds and is flexible with it's template-engine. But sometimes you might need more:

* using as Widget
* application building by creating a searchform and connect it to a JSON-API in the background: pass GET-Variables to use a dynamic JSON-Feed-URL ("talk to API / webservice")
* usage on multisite installations
* store Templates independent of pages
* more Shortcode-Parameters
* executing Shortcodes inside a template and
* more features...

If the free version comes to your limit, I'm looking forward that you [COMPARE PRO and FREE of the JSON Content Importer](http://json-content-importer.com/compare/ "COMPARE PRO and FREE of the JSON Content Importer").

= 1.1.0 =
Completely rewritten template engine for even better JSON-handling:

* "subloop-array": key should also be in the closing tag, e.g. "{subloop-array:KEY:10}{some_array_field}{/subloop-array:KEY}".
The "subloop-array" without KEY in the closing tag is ok if there is only one "subloop-array" in the template. But if there are more than one "subloop-array" in the template insert the KEY in the closing tag!
Then the template engine can identify the correct JSON-data.

* "subloop": what is above for "subloop-array" is also for "subloop", e.g.  "{subloop:KEY:10}{some_object_field}{/subloop:KEY}"

* templates like "{subloop-array:AAAA:10}{text}{subloop:AAAA.image:10}{id}{/subloop:AAAA.image}{/subloop-array:AAAA}" are possible:
one is the recursive usage of "subloop-array" and "subloop".
the other is "{subloop:AAAA.image:10}" where "AAAA.image" is the path to an object.

* JSON-data with multiple use of arrays can be handled by the template engine

= 1.0.5 =
* Added Screenshots
* Enhanced "subloop-array", new processing of pure string/numeric-array data (before: only string/numeric-data in an object)
* Enhanced FAQs: Added Link to Website for better creating shortcode-markups

= 1.0.4 =
Bugfixes

= 1.0.3 =
Enhanced the template engine for better JSON-handling.

= 1.0.2 =
